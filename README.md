# Bruter - Brouteforcer

This is a simple Python script designed for brute-force (brute-force hacking) hashes created using the MD5 algorithm, **which supports only digital combinations**.
It allows you to iterate over all number combinations from 0 to 1,000,000,000. At the same time, **it does not support leading zeros**.

There are 2 files in the repository, ru and en versions. Logically, they are divided into 2 languages - **Russian and English**.

You can change the code yourself by **adding the leading zeros function to it**, or **change the number limits**.

# Also, you can use this code as a script in your projects, thanks for watching!
